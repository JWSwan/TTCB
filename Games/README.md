Place to hold generic Game related ideas, notes, actual code if someone gets froggy. Put stuff from the Brainstorm project in here and update this README. 

# Missoula

Missoula.exe is an executable file of a game concept that can be played on your computer. The map was created in blender and imported into unity. Check it out and see if you can find the stadium in Missoula. The arrow keys will move the ball and the space bar will let you fly. The Missoula folder is a complete project that can be imported into Unity. Most of the code is boilerplate and comes with the project. The important files are in the assets subdirectoy. You will notice the fbx file that came from the blender import and two scripts that attach to objects in the game.
