##  Blender Assets

This folder is a place to store graphical elements made in Blender. Blender is a free open source 3D 
animation tool and can be downloaded [here](https://www.blender.org/download/). Assets can be imported into games or webpages easily. For example Unity allows for drag and drop importing
when the blender file is saved as .fbx file format. 


Things needed:

<ol>
<li>Textures. Making a mesh for the 3d model is less hard. Making a texture requires someone with artistic
ability to draw something to go on the mesh. All that is needed is an image file. Keep in mind that aspect 
ratio is rarely preserved as the image will be stretched or repeated over the surface of the object. </li>

<li>Sculpting. Blender has a pipeline that goes something like making the mesh -> sculpting -> adding textures 
 The mesh is easier but sculpting is hard because it requires some natural artistic talent. 
 There are less procedural tools and more time spent "pushing" and "pulling" the mesh. </li>

<li>Render Farm. If we ever get to a complex object with many textures it can take a lot of time to render.
Still images only take a few minutes. Gifs or short films take days. A render farm is easy to setup if 
everyone contributes their computer. Blender can render a range of frames and those frames can be stitched
together. Each person just needs to select a range, render it, then add it to the pile. </li>

<li>More mesh. </li>

Full credit to Annalise for this amazing texture!

<p>There are a few raw blender files in this folder, if you happen to open them press the spacebar to start the animation.  </p>
